# Baha'i Digital Library

This project is a digital library for Bahá'í prayers and writings. It leverages the Bahá'í Developer JSON API to allow users to search, view, and compare religious texts across multiple languages. With a NestJS backend handling secure API calls and a React frontend delivering an intuitive user interface, the application aims to provide an accessible, engaging resource for spiritual study and reflection.
